# Spatiotemporal_FatiguedSkills_AFL

This project assesses how various differential key performance indicators (KPIs) influence match outcomes in the AFL.

This was completed as my final assessment presentation for the `Introduction to Data Analytics for Sports Performance` module during teh Graduate Certificate for Sports Performance. 

## Features
- A data set organised per team in the AFL showcasing differential totals of key performance metrics against their opponents.
- A regression analysis of differential metrics to assess their strength in influencing winning match outcomes.
- An interactive heatmap showcasing correlations between KPIs and the Final Ladder Position.
- Lasso regression supporting `Goal` differential as the most influential performance metric.
- Table showcasing each teams Goal Differential and their predicted ladder position compared to their actual position at the end of the 2012 regular season. 

## Why it Matters
This model analysis aids coaching in focussing on metrics that promote successful match outcomes and inhibits unsuccesful outcomes for training purposes.
