# Spatiotemporal_FatiguedSkills_AFL

This project assesses how fatigue influences skill execution and decision making over the course of an AFL match.

This was completed as my final assessment presentation for the `Spatiotemporal Analysis` module during the Graduate Certificate for Sports Performance. 

## Features
- A logistic regression analysis on whether in-game fatigue effects skill execution.
- A spatial distribution of effective and ineffective skills indicating which zone of the field exhibits the most errors under varying levels of fatigue.

## Why it Matters
This model analysis aids coaches in implementing tactical alterations and improved skill executin when under fatigue.
